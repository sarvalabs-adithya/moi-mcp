/**
 * pm2 process definitions for a VM deployment.
 *
 * .cjs rather than .js because the package is ESM and pm2 reads this file with
 * require().
 *
 * Two apps, deploy whichever you need:
 *
 *   pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs --only moi-mcp-read
 *   pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs --only moi-mcp-write
 *
 * Secrets do not belong here. Put WC_PROJECT_ID in a .env file next to this
 * one; the server loads it. This file is committed, that one is not.
