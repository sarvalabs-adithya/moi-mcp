# Issues in the MOI stack

Found while building an MCP server against voyage devnet, 2026-08-26 to
2026-09-01. Each is reproducible and each blocks any third-party integrator, not
just us. Filed here so they can be raised independently of anything else.
Asset creation is **not** on this list: it works once the new asset is funded
with KMOI for its own storage, which the server now does automatically.

Environment: `js-moi-sdk@0.8.0`, `js-moi-agent-registry@0.3.0-rc1`,
MOI Wallet mobile over WalletConnect v2, RPC
`https://dev.voyage-rpc.moi.technology/devnet/`, chain `moi:14`.

---

## 1. `moi.sendInteractions` crashes MOI Wallet's local database

**Severity: blocks the documented write path entirely.**

Sending an interaction over WalletConnect with `moi.sendInteractions` fails
every time with a SQLite error leaking out of the wallet:

```
Failed to create interaction: Calling the 'finalizeAsync' function has failed
→ Caused by: Error code 19: NOT NULL constraint failed:
  interactions_metadata.number_of_operations
```

**This is not a malformed payload.** It reproduces with an interaction built by
the SDK's own builder — the same class `sarvalabs/wallet-connect-dapp` uses in
`src/contexts/JsonRpcContext.tsx`:

```ts
const ix = await new MAS0AssetLogic(KMOI_ASSET_ID, signer)
  .transfer(recipient, 1)
  .ixData({ sender: { id: account, key_id: 0, sequence } });

await client.request({
  topic, chainId: "moi:14",
  request: { method: "moi.sendInteractions", params: [ix] },
});
```

The same interaction simulates cleanly against the node (`moi.Call` →
`receipt.status: 0`, `fuel_used: 0x12b`), and the identical payload signs and
broadcasts successfully via the workaround below. So the interaction is valid;
the wallet fails while writing its own metadata row.

**Workaround, and what the server ships:** call `moi.signInteraction` with
the same positional `params: [ix]`, and broadcast the returned
`{ ix_args, signatures }` yourself via the node's `moi.SendInteractions`. That
path works — confirmed on chain at
`0x3c568254d339090d1e0ec256f9ac46fe288aab7d7739275e2267ddff3fdbc009`
(status 0, 299 fuel). The phone still shows the approval screen and still
holds the only key; the dapp merely relays the signed bytes.

**Note:** a dapp should never see a SQLite constraint error. Even once the
underlying cause is fixed, a validation failure would be more useful than an
internal DB error.

## 2. `AccountState.nonce` is declared in the SDK types but never returned

**Severity: silent wrong values, hard to trace.**

`js-moi-providers` declares:

```ts
export interface AccountState {
    nonce: string;
    // ...
}
```

The node does not return that field. `provider.getAccountState(id).nonce` is
`undefined`, which any reasonable numeric coercion turns into `0` — so an
account that has transacted several times reports a nonce of 0, and the wallet
then rejects the interaction with **"invalid nonce"**.

The type is what makes this expensive: it asserts a field exists, so nobody
thinks to check, and the failure surfaces two layers away as a wallet
rejection.

**Correct source**, and what the SDK's own `Signer.getNonce()` uses:

```ts
await provider.getPendingInteractionCount(id, keyId)
```

**Suggested fix:** mark it optional (`nonce?: string`) or remove it. Either
makes the compiler surface the problem at the call site.

---

## 3. `AgentRegistry.init()` requires a private key to perform reads

**Severity: unusable from any keyless process.**

```ts
export interface SDKConfig {
    wallet: Signer;      // required
    uploader?: CardUploader;
}
static init(config: SDKConfig): Promise<AgentRegistry>;
```

`getAgentProfile`, `getAgentsByOwner`, `getAllAgentIds` and `getAgentCount` are
all read-only, but the class cannot be constructed without a `Signer`. Anything
that deliberately holds no keys — an indexer, a public API, an MCP server —
cannot use the package for reads at all.

**Workaround:** bypass the class and call `getLogicDriver(LOGIC_ID, signer)`
with a Signer that carries a provider and throws on both signing methods.

**Suggested fix:** accept a provider, or add a `AgentRegistry.readOnly(provider)`
constructor that exposes only the query methods.

## 4. Four undocumented JSON-RPC details

**Severity: hours of debugging each, for anyone not reading the SDK source.**

Found while writing a second client in Go against the same endpoint. None is
in the public JSON-RPC docs; all four are only discoverable by reading
`js-moi-providers`.

| Detail | What happens if you get it wrong |
|---|---|
| Params are wrapped: `params: [{...}]`, not positional | `empty options` |
| The identifier key is `id`, not `identifier` | `invalid identifier` — reads like a bad address, not a wrong field name |
| Most reads need an `options` block; `{"tesseract_number": -1}` means latest | `empty options`, even with a valid id |
| Asset standard is in bytes 2..3 of the asset id | No `standard` field on `AssetInfo`; you assume it is missing data |

The second one is the worst: `invalid identifier` sends you off validating the
address you passed, when the address was fine and the *field name* was wrong.

**Suggested fix:** one worked `curl` example per method in the JSON-RPC docs
would close all four.

## Two smaller notes

**Registry has no state on devnet.** The logic at
`0x20000000c684f926ed158d0cbfe66af0e482a389393e7899a5a73fcb00000000`
loads its manifest and exposes 11 routines, but every routine call fails with
`state object fetch failed: failed to fetch acc meta info: account not found`.
Presumably nothing has been registered yet — worth confirming that is expected
rather than a deployment problem.

**Read-only logic calls need a caller that exists on chain.** `getLogicDriver`
routes reads through a `Signer`, and the node resolves that caller's account
meta info, so a synthetic identity fails. A read failing for reasons unrelated
to what is being read is surprising. Is there a canonical read-only caller, or
should simulation not require a resolvable sender?

## 5. Delegation surfaces are half-implemented and half-documented

**Severity: anyone designing agent spend control will pick the wrong primitive.**

MOI has three things that look like delegation (`docs/findings.md` §6 has the
evidence):

- **Access policies** (`ACCESS_CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE`): `ResourceType` declares
  `STORAGE/ASSET/LOGIC/KEY` and `AccessAction` declares `ASSET_ACCESS` and
  `LOGIC_ACCESS`, but the SDK validator throws on anything except `STORAGE`
  and the devnet node answers `only 'storage' resource type is implemented`.
  The policy type has no amount, limit, rate or expiry field. The
  `moi.AccessPolicy` / `moi.AccessPolicies` RPCs and the SDK `Access` class
  are not in the public docs.
- **Account keys** (`ACCOUNT_CONFIGURE`): weights 0–1000 against a fixed
  threshold of 1000. No per-key scope, cap or expiry. Documented.
- **MAS0 mandates** (`Approve`/`TransferFrom`/`Revoke`): amount + `expires_at`
  per (asset, grantee), revocable, and the grantee signs with its own key.
  Documented as "Mandates"; `moi.Mandates` RPC documented; no provider helper
  in `js-moi-providers@0.8.0`. Whether the cap decrements cumulatively across
  `TransferFrom`s is not stated.

**Suggested fix:** document which `ResourceType`/`AccessAction` values are live
per network, publish the access-policy RPCs, and state mandate accounting.

## Also worth knowing

`moi.sendInteractions` (wallet, camelCase) and `moi.SendInteractions` (node,
PascalCase) differ only in casing and do different things on different
transports. That is a genuine trap; naming them distinctly would help.

Manifest elements that are routines carry `kind: "callable"`, not `"routine"`
(`js-moi-utils` `ElementType.ROUTINE = "callable"`). Anyone filtering a raw
manifest by the obvious word gets an empty list — we did.

The node returns `asset_deeds` on `moi.AccountState` where the SDK type says
`asset_approvals`, and returns no `nonce` (issue 2). Two more places the types
and the wire disagree.


## 3. `moi.signInteraction` has no way to show the user what they are signing

**Severity: limits how informed a phone approval can be.**

Every write tool composes a plain sentence ("Transfer 50 KMOI to 0x…") for the
user to approve. There is nowhere to put it. `moi.signInteraction` takes only
the interaction (`params: [address, ix]` in `sarvalabs/wallet-connect-dapp`,
`[ixRequest]` in the extension's SPECIFICATION.md), and the interaction format
has no memo or label field. The wallet therefore renders whatever it can decode
from the raw operations. For a transfer that is legible; for an asset create,
a mint, or a logic call with encoded calldata, it is much less so.

**Workaround, and what the server ships:** the write tools instruct the model
to state amount, asset, and recipient and get an explicit yes *before* the
call, and echo that sentence back with the hash. The chat is the approval
screen the user can actually read; the phone tap confirms it.

**Wallet-side fix:** accept an optional second param (or a `meta.description`
like the `ix_args` style already models for `sendInteractions`) and render it
above the decoded operations.
