# Give your agent a MOI wallet in 5 minutes

**Before you start:** [Node.js 20 or later](https://nodejs.org) (`node -v` to
check) and the [MOI Wallet](https://docs.wallet.moi.technology/getting-started/download)
app on your phone (Android, iOS, or the Chrome extension).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide runs on `voyage`, MOI's **devnet**. The KMOI you'll use below is
> test currency with no real value — claim some free from the
> [Voyage faucet](https://voyage.moi.technology/faucet/), or ask in the
> [MOI Discord](https://discord.gg/5gG6efFN4s) if the faucet is empty.

## 1. Get a WalletConnect project id (1 min)

Sign in at [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com), create a project, copy
the project id. This is what lets your machine and your phone find each other
through the WalletConnect relay. It is not a secret key.

## 2. Add the server to your client (1 min)

**Claude Desktop** — edit `claude_desktop_config.json`. It lives at:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

If the file doesn't exist yet, open Claude Desktop once (then quit it) — it
creates the file on first launch. If it already has an `mcpServers` block,
**merge** into it — add `"moi"` as a new key, don't overwrite the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@moi-protocol/mcp-server"],
      "env": { "MOI_NETWORK": "voyage", "WC_PROJECT_ID": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT_ID" }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude completely (quit the app, not just the window). `moi` should
appear in the tools list with 13 tools.

**Cursor** — same block in `.cursor/mcp.json`. See `examples/cursor.mcp.json`.

<!-- TODO screenshot: the MOI tools listed in the client's tool picker -->

## 3. Read something (30 sec)

No pairing needed yet. Ask:

> what MOI networks can you reach?

The agent reads `moi://networks`. Then try a real account:

> look up MOI account 0x…

## 4. Pair your phone (2 min)

Don't have MOI Wallet yet? [Download it](https://docs.wallet.moi.technology/getting-started/download)
for Android, iOS, or the Chrome extension.

> connect my MOI wallet

A QR code appears in the chat. Open MOI Wallet on your phone, scan it, approve.

<!-- TODO screenshot: QR in chat, MOI Wallet approval screen -->

Prefer the terminal? `npx -y -p @moi-protocol/mcp-server moi-mcp pair` prints the same QR.

Confirm it landed:

> what's my MOI wallet status?

## 5. Send something (30 sec)

No KMOI yet? Claim free devnet tokens from the
[Voyage faucet](https://voyage.moi.technology/faucet/).

> send 1 KMOI to 0x…

The agent resolves the asset, checks your balance, builds the interaction,
simulates it against the node, and pushes it to your phone. **Nothing is signed
until you tap Approve.** The phone returns the signature; the server broadcasts
it and hands you the hash. Reject it and you get back
`{"status":"rejected","reason":"user_rejected"}`. Ignore it for five minutes and
you get `"timeout"`.

Creating a token works the same way — `create an asset called MCPTEST with
supply 1000`. A new asset must hold some KMOI to pay for
its own storage; the default is 1,000,000, so pass a smaller `storageFund` on a
small devnet balance.

<!-- TODO screenshot: approval screen, then the interaction hash in chat -->

Then:

> did that interaction land?

## What just happened

Your agent never saw a private key. It read the chain over JSON-RPC, built an
unsigned interaction locally, sent it over the WalletConnect relay to the only
thing that can sign — your phone — and then submitted the signed bytes to the
node itself. The server relays a signature; it never produces one.

## Next

- `moi_resolve_agent` finds other agents in the on-chain registry, so your agent
  can discover and pay them.
- `moi_call_logic` with `kind:"view"` reads any deployed logic with no wallet at
  all.
- `moi_get_logic` lists a logic's routines so the agent knows what to call.
